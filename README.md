# Portfolio
A list of various projects throughout the years I have worked on. This Portfolio contains projects I would consider falling into these categories:

**Mechanical:** Good examples of my skills related to Mechanical Engineering

-  Test_Plans_and_Project_Requirements_Compliance-Integration_example: The shortened version of the work I did while the Lead Testing Engineer.  All documentation is entirely my own work, as well as the development and implementation of these test plans and the verification of requirements. 
- Ultrasonic Levitator: An "Individual Project" students were required to do during Covid. I decided to go the extra mile and test my engineering prowess to see if I could accomplish such a feat (as opposed to making something very easy and simple).  Large .zip file, containing the Arduino code, electrical schematics, documentation, and various other files. 
- It_works: Short video of the ultrasonic levitator working (if you dont want to download the large .zip file) 
- Rocketry Recovery Calcs Example: An example of the type of calculations I did while a secondary recovery officer for the NASA USLI competition in 2021-2022. 

**Aerospace:** Good examples of my skills related to Aerospace Engineering

-  Research poster: A brief overview of my 2.5 years at UTSI.  This poster was created about halfway through my MS degree. 

**Physics:** Goods example of my skills related to physics.

-  Dipole: Requires Antenna Toolbox to run, the rad pattern of a RP-SMA antenna at 900 MHz. 

**Fun:** Just some projects I am actively working on. 

-  Personal Rockets: requires OpenRocket to view files, these are drafts of rockets I have made, or are in the process of making. 
-  Guitar: MATLAB 3d surface map of the action heights for my Fender Squire Strat, I need to fix it.
