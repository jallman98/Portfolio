# Portfolio
A list of various projects throughout the years I have worked on. This Portfolio contains projects I would consider falling into these categories:

**Good examples of my skills related to Mechanical Engineering:**

-  Test_Plans_and_Project_Requirements_Compliance-Integration_example: The shortened version of the work I did while the Lead Testing Engineer.  All documentation is entirely my own work, as well as the development and implementation of these test plans and the verification of requirements. 
- Ultrasonic Levitator: An "Individual Project" students were required to do during Covid. I decided to go the extra mile and test my engineering prowess to see if I could accomplish such a feat (as opposed to making something very easy and simple).  Large .zip file, containing the Arduino code, electrical schematics, documentation, and various other files. 
- It_works: Short video of the ultrasonic levitator working (if you dont want to download the large .zip file) 
- Rocketry Recovery Calcs Example: An example of the type of calculations I did while a secondary recovery officer for the NASA USLI competition in 2021-2022. 

**Good examples of my skills related to Aerospace Engineering:**

-  "FRR" or Flight Readiness Review is the final document sent to NASA engineers in the USLI competition.  This is the culmination of nearly ten thousand hours of work between myself and many other individuals who worked on this project. I saw this project begin and end, and had a hand in nearly every page on this document. 
-  Research poster: A brief overview of my 2.5 years at UTSI.  This poster was created about halfway through my MS degree. 

**Good example of my skills related to physics:**

-  Quantum Mechanics - Transmission Electron Microscopes: A ppt presentation I gave as a final project during my QM class. 
-  Dipole: Requires Antenna Toolbox to run, the rad pattern of a RP-SMA antenna at 900 MHz. 

**Just some projects I am actively working on for fun:**

-  Personal Rockets: requires OpenRocket to view files, these are drafts of rockets I have made, or are in the process of making. 
-  Guitar: MATLAB 3d surface map of the action heights for my Fender Squire Strat, I need to fix it.
